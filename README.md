# ðŸ“† CalendarMe-Open-Source
An open source version of my on-going OpenAI, Google Calendar, OpenWeatherMap project. This repository may be updated intermittently.

## ðŸª€ How to use
You cannot run CalendarMe presentl as you need various API keys and credentials. These I have chosen to omit for security reasons but may be included if any interest is sparked.

## ðŸ”® Future
I plan on recreating the project in nodeJS and Electron such that it is more visually appealing and potentially give it a formal release.
